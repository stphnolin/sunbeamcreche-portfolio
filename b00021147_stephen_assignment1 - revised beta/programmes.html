          <h2>Early Years</h2>
          <p>
            Our Early years program provides a home from home service. With plenty of love and care from our experienced childcare workers. We work with parents over a settling in period which lasts a few days to ensure your child is happy and comfortable in our setting. During this period, we learn what your child daily routine consists off (meal times, sleeping patterns and all the other special things that your child needs).  
          </p>
          <p>
            Each day upon your return you will be given feedback on your child's day from our staff members and a hand-written book especially for your child which contains, food, nappies, sleeps and comments on your child on what they done during the day.  When your child starts you will be asked to provide a few spare changes of clothes which will be kept in the creche in your child's own basket along with nappies, wipes and creams.

          <h2>After School</h2>
          <p>
            Here at Sunbeams we provide after-school care to the local schools. In the mornings the children are brought to school by a staff member/creche car. We drop and collect to a range of schools in the Hartstown, Huntstown and Mountview area. Our staff are very passionate about childcare and provide an excellent standard of education to the children.  We provide a home from home environment for all the children in our care daily. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The children are provided with a hot meal on return to the creche from school, then its onto homework time were the children are assisted by a member of staff to complete their homework. After the children are finished they can engage in a variety of activities of their choice such as Art&amp;crafts, Story time, Free play, Messy play, Construction etc. This way the children can unwind from there busy day at school and have some fun with the children their own age.
